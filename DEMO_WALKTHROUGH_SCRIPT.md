## ✂️ Editing Tips for "Interesting"

1.  **Speed Ramps:** Fast-forward any loading screens or typing. Viewers read faster than you type.
2.  **Zoom Cuts:** When showing the "Inline AI" (step 10), **zoom in** on the video editor so they clearly see the text change.
3.  **Music:** Use an upbeat, modern background track (lo-fi or tech-house) to keep the energy up.
4.  **No Dead Air:** Never have the mouse just sitting there. Always be moving to the next action.
